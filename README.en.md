## üìù Preparation
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Important:** Choose a server located abroad and not blocked in your region. For the domain name, there is no need to register it with domestic authorities. You can also apply for a free domain through various platforms. During the one-click deployment process, if you choose to install Caddy, it will automatically configure HTTPS. If you opt to deploy Nginx, you'll need to apply for a free SSL certificate yourself or use other methods to implement SSL encryption.

**Method one:** [Acme.sh Automatically Generate and Renew Lets Encrypt Free SSL Certificate](https://www.dqzboy.com/16437.html)

**Method two:** Domain hosted to[Cloudflare enabling free SSL certificate](https://www.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/application-services/products/ssl/)

**Method Three:** You can apply for a free domain certificate (typically a DV certificate) through a third-party platform, suitable for personal websites, blogs, and small projects.

<summary><strong>If you don't have the environment mentioned above, you can try the following several schemes</strong></summary>
<div>

**Scheme one:**  üöÄ üöÄ If you don't have the things mentioned above, you can also deploy to **[Render](Render/README.md)**

**Scheme two:** If you only have one server and don't want to deal with domain names or configure TLS, then you can configure Docker's configuration file `daemon.json`, and specify `insecure-registries` to configure your image acceleration address

**Scheme three:** If you're deploying on a server within China, you can configure proxies while executing one-click deployment, which will also help solve the problem of Docker not being able to install domestically

> **During the deployment process, if you encounter any issues or questions, please scroll down to find the [problem](Issue/issue.en.md), see if your situation has been listed! Try to resolve it yourself first.**

## üì¶ Deploy
### Deploy through project script
```shell
# CentOS && RHEL && Rocky
yum -y install curl
# ubuntu && debian
apt -y install curl

# overseas environment
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dqzboy/Docker-Proxy/main/install/DockerProxy_Install.sh)"

# domestic environment
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dqzboy/Docker-Proxy/install/DockerProxy_Install.sh)"
```

### Deployment to Third-Party Platforms
<details>
<summary><strong>Deploy to Render</strong></summary>
<div>

> Render offers a free quota, and you can further increase the quota after adding a card.

Deploy quickly with Render: [View Tutorial](Render/README.md)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Deploy to Koyeb</strong></summary>
<div>

> The domain name assigned by Koyeb is not very stable when accessed in the domestic area, not highly recommended!

Deploy quickly with Koyeb: [View Tutorial](Koyeb/README.md)

</details>


### Docker Compose Deployment
<details>
<summary><strong>Manual Container Deployment</strong></summary>
<div>

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Download the configuration for whichever mirror repository you need to accelerate. The `docker-compose.yaml` file by default deploys the acceleration service for all foreign mirror repositories, again you configure whichever one you deploy, and delete the rest!

**1.** Download the corresponding `yml` file from the [config](https://github.com/dqzboy/Docker-Proxy/tree/main/config) directory to your local machine.

**2.** Download the [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/dqzboy/Docker-Proxy/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) file to your local machine and place it in the same directory level as the configuration file.

**3.** Execute the `docker compose` command to start the container service.
```shell
docker compose up -d

# View container logs
docker logs -f [Container ID or Name]
```

**4.** If you are not familiar with Nginx or Caddy, you can use a service you are familiar with for proxying. You can also access directly via IP and port number.

## üî® Features
- [x] One-click deployment of Docker image proxy services, supporting proxy based on the official Docker Registry. 
- [x] Supports proxy for multiple image repositories, including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io), Quay Container Registry (quay.io), Kubernetes Container Registry (k8s.gcr.io), Microsoft Container (mcr.microsoft.com), Elastic Stack (docker.elastic.co).
- [x] Automatically checks for and installs required dependency software such as Docker, Nginx/Caddy, etc., and ensures the system environment meets the operational requirements.
- [x] Automatically renders the corresponding Nginx or Caddy service configuration based on the service you choose to deploy.
- [x] Supports login to Docker Hub with configured account password to access private mirrors on Docker Hub and solve the download frequency limitation of Docker Hub.
- [x] Support custom configuration of proxy cache time(PROXY_TTL)„ÄÅSupport configuring IP whitelist and blacklist to prevent malicious attacks.
- [x] Provides features for restarting services, updating services, updating configurations, and uninstalling services, making it convenient for users to perform daily management and maintenance.
- [x] Supports user selection of whether to provide authentication during deployment.
- [x] Supports configuration of proxy (HTTP_PROXY), only supports HTTP.
- [x] Solves the problem of being unable to install Docker services in the domestic environment.
- [x] Supports mainstream Linux distribution operating systems, such as CentOS, Ubuntu, Rocky, Debian, RHEL, etc.
- [x] Supports deployment on mainstream ARCH architectures, including linux/amd64, linux/arm64.

## ‚ú® Tutorial
#### Configure Nginx Reverse Proxy
> **Note**Ôºö If you choose to deploy with Nginx, after the proxy program is deployed, you need to configure Nginx yourself.<br>

**1.Download the [registry-proxy.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dqzboy/Docker-Proxy/main/nginx/registry-proxy.conf) configuration file from the repository to your Nginx service and modify the domain name and certificate sections in the configuration** <br>
**2.Resolve the corresponding access domain name to the IP of the machine where the Docker proxy service is deployed at your DNS service provider** <br>
**3.Modify the Docker daemon.json configuration to configure your self-built Registry address. Restart Docker after modification**
```shell
~]# vim /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
    "registry-mirrors": [ "https://hub.your_domain_name" ],
    "log-opts": {
      "max-size": "100m",
      "max-file": "5"
    }
}
```

> **ExplanationÔºö** After configuring the daemon.json, you no longer need to specify your acceleration address when pulling images; simply execute docker pull to retrieve the images you need. The following steps are for when you have not configured the daemon.json, and you need to include your acceleration address to pull images normally.

---

**1. Replace the official Registry address with your own Registry address to pull the image.**
```shell
# Docker Hub Registry
## Original: nginx:latest
## Replace with:
docker pull hub.your_domain_name/library/nginx:latest

# Google Registry
## Original: gcr.io/google-containers/pause:3.1
## Replace with:
docker pull gcr.your_domain_name/google-containers/pause:3.1
```

**2. Prefix replacement reference for the Registry.**

| Source | Replace with | Platform |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| docker.io   | hub.your_domain_name   |  docker hub 
| gcr.io      | gcr.your_domain_name   |  Google Container Registry
| ghcr.io     | ghcr.your_domain_name  |  GitHub Container Registry
| k8s.gcr.io     | k8s-gcr.your_domain_name  | Kubernetes Container Registry
| registry.k8s.io     | k8s.your_domain_name  | Kubernetes's container image registry
| quay.io     | quay.your_domain_name  | Quay Container Registry
| mcr.microsoft.com     | mcr.your_domain_name  | Microsoft Container Registry
| docker.elastic.co     | elastic.your_domain_name  | Elastic Stack
| nvcr.io    | nvcr.your_domain_name  | NVIDIA Container Registry
